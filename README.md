# Garbage Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project implements a **Garbage Classification system** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with **TensorFlow/Keras**. The model is designed to classify images of garbage into various categories to aid in efficient waste management and recycling efforts. The dataset used for training the model contains over 12,000 images of waste materials in 14 different categories, such as plastic, metal, paper, glass, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle: Garbage Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mostafaabla/garbage-classification). It consists of images belonging to the following 14 categories:
1. Battery
2. Brown-glass
3. Clothes
4. Metal
5. Plastic
6. Trash
7. Biological
8. Cardboard
9. Green-glass
10. Paper
11. Shoes
12. White-glass
13. Organic Waste
14. Others

The images are pre-labeled, and the task is to train a deep learning model to accurately classify these images into their respective categories.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a robust model that can accurately predict the type of waste material from an image. This has applications in waste sorting systems and recycling plants, where accurate classification of waste is crucial for efficient processing.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/garbage-classification.git
Install the required dependencies:

2. **This project requires Python 3.7+ and TensorFlow. Install the dependencies using pip:**



pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Dataset: Download the dataset from Kaggle and extract it. Ensure that you place the dataset in the correct folder structure as expected by the code.**

Alternatively, you can directly load the dataset into Google Colab using Kaggle's API.

**Model Architecture**
The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following layers:

Convolutional layers to extract spatial features from the images.

MaxPooling layers to down-sample the feature maps.

Dense layers to classify the images based on extracted features.

The CNN model is trained using the Adam optimizer with binary crossentropy loss and accuracy as the performance metric.


**Training the Model**
Once you have the dataset set up and dependencies installed, you can train the model by running the following script:
python train.py
This will begin the training process. The model will be trained for 10 epochs and will be saved to a file once training is complete.


**Evaluation and Results**
After training, the model will be evaluated on a separate test dataset. The accuracy of the model will be printed, and a confusion matrix will be generated to show where the model makes incorrect predictions.
command:
python evaluate.py

**Example Predictions**
Once the model is trained, you can test it on new images by running the predict.py script. The predictions are displayed along with the true labels.

bash python predict.py
This will output the predicted class for each image, showing the class that the model assigned.

**Visualizing Training Progress**
The training process includes visualizations of the training and validation accuracy over epochs. You can use matplotlib to visualize the model's progress and understand how well the model is learning.
